# WZP (World Zero Project)
### Introduction

I have been developing major projects under the WZP (World Zero Project). One of the reasons I have not yet published or uploaded the source code to GitHub is that I frequently revise the blueprints before programming the software projects. These revisions often lead to significant changes in the code.

### Current Projects
I will try to publish the source code before December 20, 2024. Here are the projects I am working on as part of WZP in .NET 8:

#### * A Programming Language

#### * A Framework

#### * An Implemented Framework

#### * A Real Project

## Stay tuned for more updates!
