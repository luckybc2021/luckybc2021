# My Life in Vietnam: Struggles, Survival, and Seeking Justice


If you are wondering why you don't see me uploading open-source projects, I have two reasons.

1. I am still developing and improving these projects.
	
2. I live in a not-so-good environment and am always harmed by the bad people around me, even though I have reported them to the authorities and the police in Nha Be district, Ho Chi Minh City, where I have lived for the past 10 years. But the bad/evil wins with the assistance of the police and the authorities in Nha Be district, neglecting my safety and health. I am accused of slandering state officials. When the authorities slander me as lying and harming those who harm me, I don't see any reason to contribute to Vietnam. What I do will belong to these people and their descendants.
	
	 It's not worth it!
	
When I complete most of my projects, I will upload them under my name Vo Song Toan, but not for Vietnam, because I am harmed in this country. When I earn enough sponsorship money, I will leave Vietnam. I was born and raised in Vietnam, but my entire life of 32 years, from birth to now, has never been happy, always being harmed.

If you see me posting about Vietnam on LinkedIn.com, it's because I have some positive thoughts about Vietnam. But I don't want to spend the rest of my life being harmed. I have to leave Vietnam. Because I don't have human rights, and basic rights, including the right to request protection from the Vietnamese government and laws as a Vietnamese citizen.





# AIs x Intelligent Human



It's misguided to think that AIs, including Deep Seek, will replace software developers, especially the highly skilled ones. Nothing is free. Currently, AI companies have amassed vast amounts of data from around the world. For those unaware, AIs operate on patterns and selective algorithms to generate results ranging from the worst to the best, depending on how much you pay.



Right now, AIs are affordable because they aim to push software developers out of the market, as hiring high-quality and intelligent IT/software developers is expensive. By diminishing the market, they allow less experienced developers and normal users to rely on AIs, leading to potential failure. Without sufficient knowledge and experience as a software developer, one cannot achieve much. Normal users and developers might think that AIs will make them millionaires, but the answer is absolutely no.



As mentioned earlier, AIs have gathered information from around the world, especially from open-source projects. However, it's about a selective system of the best and worst projects. If you don't pay enough to get the best results and use the worst results in real life, it can lead to disastrous consequences. Instead of asking AIs for harmful advice, understand that poor results can worsen your life significantly.



Remember, no money falls from the sky. Nothing is free.


# Future of Work: 39% Job Skills to Become Outdated by 2030

I am not certain that AI and robots will replace humans entirely. However, I am confident that people worldwide should proactively learn and utilize AI and robotics to enhance and acquire new skills. Doing so will enable them to secure new jobs in the future.


# AI Era

Databases and software started out as distinct fields at the beginning of programming and database management. In the current AI era, software developers will adapt to AIs changing the way we program and develop database applications. End users will be able to manage their own databases, choosing AI agents like Copilot to see and manage their data, or using paid/free software solutions. This means software developers will still have jobs, and users will have more control over their own databases. Software development jobs won't disappear; rather, we are transitioning from a quantity-based to a quality-based standard.

More people will embrace AI agents like Copilot, giving them more rights to manage their own databases instead of handing them over to unknown entities. This shift will lead to more creative and higher-quality software applications. Low-paid, less-skilled jobs will decline, while those with creative talents will leverage AI to create new jobs suitable for various skill sets. You won't need to feel inadequate for not knowing how to program applicationsâ€”AI agents are tools to enhance human capabilities, not replace them.

The number of software developers worldwide is vast, but the availability of high-quality applications is diminishing. Embracing the AI era and changing the way we live and work will be essential. While AI can transform software development, the need for real, high-quality applications will always require skilled developers.


# WZP (World Zero Project)
### Introduction
Welcome to the World Zero Project (WZP). I've been tirelessly developing significant projects under the WZP umbrella. One of the reasons the source code hasn't been published or uploaded to GitHub yet is due to the frequent blueprint revisions that precede the programming stage. These revisions often result in substantial code changes.

### Current Projects
I aim to publish the source code by December 20, 2024. Here are the exciting projects I'm working on as part of WZP, all developed in .NET 8:

- **A Programming Language:** Crafting a new language to solve modern computing challenges.
- **A Framework:** Building a versatile framework to simplify development tasks.
- **An Implemented Framework:** Implementing and enhancing the framework for real-world applications.
- **A Real Project:** Bringing all elements together in a practical, real-world application.

### Stay Connected
- **Discord:** I'm available to answer any questions about WZP on [Discord](https://discord.gg/AaVEWaaS).
- **LinkedIn:** Check out my latest LinkedIn post [here](https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:7270014564551815171) (Right-click and select "Open link in new tab" to view).

## Stay tuned for more updates!
