# WZP (World Zero Project)
### Introduction
Welcome to the World Zero Project (WZP). I've been tirelessly developing significant projects under the WZP umbrella. One of the reasons the source code hasn't been published or uploaded to GitHub yet is due to the frequent blueprint revisions that precede the programming stage. These revisions often result in substantial code changes.

### Current Projects
I aim to publish the source code by December 20, 2024. Here are the exciting projects I'm working on as part of WZP, all developed in .NET 8:

- **A Programming Language:** Crafting a new language to solve modern computing challenges.
- **A Framework:** Building a versatile framework to simplify development tasks.
- **An Implemented Framework:** Implementing and enhancing the framework for real-world applications.
- **A Real Project:** Bringing all elements together in a practical, real-world application.

### Stay Connected
- **Discord:** I'm available to answer any questions about WZP on [Discord](https://discord.gg/AaVEWaaS).
